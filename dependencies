# MacOS Compatibility Issue with ElizaAI Agent

## Core Issue
When attempting to run the ElizaAI agent on MacOS 11.7.9 (Big Sur), we're encountering compatibility issues with `onnxruntime-node`. The error occurs because the binary is built for MacOS 13.3 (Ventura) and isn't backward compatible.

## Specific Error
```
Error: dlopen(...onnxruntime_binding.node): Symbol not found: __ZNKSt3__115basic_stringbufIcNS_11char_traitsIcEENS_9allocatorIcEEE3strEv
Referenced from: .../libonnxruntime.1.20.1.dylib (which was built for Mac OS X 13.3)
Expected in: /usr/lib/libc++.1.dylib
```

## Attempted Solutions
1. Tried using an older version of onnxruntime-node (1.14.0)
2. Attempted to override onnxruntime-node with onnxruntime-web using pnpm overrides
3. Removed direct dependency from agent package.json

## Current Project Structure
- Using pnpm workspaces
- Node.js version 23.3.0
- Multiple packages including ML-related ones that might depend on onnxruntime:
  - @huggingface/transformers
  - fastembed
  - echogarden

## Next Steps for Investigation
1. Need to identify which package(s) are actually requiring onnxruntime
2. Consider alternatives:
   - Patching packages to use different ML backends
   - Disabling functionality that requires onnxruntime
   - Finding alternative packages with better backward compatibility

## For Developers
When building agents for older machines, consider:
1. Using web-based alternatives to native ML libraries
2. Implementing feature detection/graceful degradation for ML features
3. Providing configuration options to disable ML-dependent features
4. Building with broader OS compatibility in mind (not just latest versions)

## Current System Details
- MacOS: 11.7.9 (Big Sur)
- Node: v23.3.0
- Hardware: Unable to upgrade beyond MacOS 11 due to age limitations

Feel free to continue troubleshooting from here, or propose alternative architectures that would better support older hardware configurations.
